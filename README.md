Arctic regions are warming as much as four times faster than the global average (Rantanen et al. 2022), creating the potential for rapid environmental change. Hillsope failures, such as permafrost thaw slumps, are an increasing signature of the new climatic regime on the landscape (Kokelj et al. 2021). Here, we track the growth of hillslope failures over time using image segmentation. By seeding segmentation regions, we extract failure areas from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and quantify average growth rates during the summer season from 2016 to 2024. These growth rates serve as an estimate of carbon-rich sediments transitioning from colluvial to alluvial systems.
